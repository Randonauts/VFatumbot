#### INSTRUCTIONS  
  
First up you need to send a location which will be the center to generate points from by tapping üåç/üìé, or sending a Google Maps URL. If you have the Place Search Pack you can do so by typing \"search <place name or address>\".  
  
##### MAIN MENU  
  
* Attractor (/getattractor) - generate an Attractor point  
* Void (/getvoid) - generate a Void point  
* Options/Help - set the search radius (/setradius 3000), displaying in-app map previews and enabling skipping water points and view this help  
* Blind Spots & More submenu - see below  
* My Location - show your currently set location  
  
You can enter [1]-[10] after the commands to search for up to that number of points; e.g. /getattractor[3]  
  
##### BLIND SPOTS & MORE  
  
* Quantum (/getquantum) - get a single quantumly generated point (Blind Spot)  
* Intent Suggestions (/getintents) - get some quantumly random generated word suggestions for an intent to set  
* Mystery Point (/getpoint) - generate a random type of point (for blind-experiments)  
* Anomaly (/getanomaly, /getida) - get the strongest Attractor or Void point  
* Pair (/getpair) - get a pair of Attractor and Void points  
* Quantum Time (/getqtime) - same as above but with a suggested time to visit
